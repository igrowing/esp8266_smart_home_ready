Alternative for Light [Bulb Timer for Gewiss Systems](https://www.gewiss.com/ww/en/products/experience-catalogue/catalogs/series/product/domotics/chorus---domestic-range-white-modular-devices/GW10583).

## Why?

1. It's confusing to pay ~$200 for a bulb switch.
2. It's fun to develop something simple from scratch.

## What?

- When it's dark, the press on button lits the bulb for 2 minutes. When there is an ambient light, no electricity spent on lighting.
- No other smart features, no networking, no reporting, no movement sensing... Stupid cheap simple module.
- The "LED" marked component is a photodiode, transparent, 5mm.
